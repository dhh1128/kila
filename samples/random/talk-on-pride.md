This sacred volume was written for us—for our day. Its scriptures are to be likened unto ourselves. (See 1 Ne. 19:23.)| kit tom sankt d skribdy fo vi -- fo vid ju, id skribsankt d faindidmdu aho vi (zia 1 ne 19:23)
The Doctrine and Covenants tells us that the Book of Mormon is the “record of a fallen people.” (D&C 20:9.) | -dxktryn n vxpqkt- tel d vi k -liv d mormn- bi z /-rejist d vxant faln-/. (-dnv- 20:9)
Why did they fall? This is one of the major messages of the Book of Mormon.| uai ve faldy? kit bi un d mesyj mejr d -lv d mormn-.
Mormon gives the answer in the closing chapters of the book in these words:| -mormn gyv qnsr yn vxcqptm fynyk dz liv yn vxki urd:
“Behold, the pride of this nation, or the people of the Nephites, hath proven their destruction.” (Moro. 8:27)| /-kendu, z orgu d ki vxantstat, u d vxnefaivntim, d provdy ved destrxkcn.-/ (mxr 8:27)
And then, lest we miss that momentous Book of Mormon message from that fallen people,|
the Lord warns us in the Doctrine and Covenants, “Beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.” (D&C 38:39.)

I earnestly seek an interest in your faith and prayers as I strive to bring forth light on this Book of Mormon message—the sin of pride. This message has been weighing heavily on my soul for some time. I know the Lord wants this message delivered now.
