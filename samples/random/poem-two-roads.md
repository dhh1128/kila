The Road Not Taken | -rod-z eiteikn
by Robert Frost | pr -rabrt -frast
<br>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, | <br>2 rod yn 1 uwd elo dy-splyt 
And sorry I could not travel both | n trist k i dy-eipd rutgo z 2
And be one traveler, long I stood | n bi jxst 1 rutgor, i stqnddygx lang 
And looked down one as far as I could | n geizdygx daun 1 i so lon dy-pd
To where it bent in the undergrowth; | a uer e d virdygx yn z sugro;
<br>Then took the other, as just as fair, | <br>den teikdy i ot-z, fo idm so li,
And having perhaps the better claim, | n hqvngx prc - z klem - plubon,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; | pask e bidy grqsyk n vldygx uer;
Though as for that the passing there | sep ri ide ia - z pqsn tr ia
Had worn them really about the same, | uerhq d 2 vreyk kasi idmi,
<br>And both that morning equally lay | <br>n 2-z ia morn lwgdygx - id'mi
In leaves no step had trodden black. | yn lwf no vxstep evr tredhq a nor.
Oh, I kept the first for another day! | o, i kipdy 1xm-z tr ju - ot!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, | sep sabn hau rut evr lid a z rut
I doubted if I should ever come back. | retrn d i, evr, dy-fyl i ko dut.
<br>I shall be telling this with a sigh | <br>i telvygx kit -, n 1 suspir ko,
Somewhere ages and ages hence: | sxmri, vxeij n vxeij - ap so,
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I&mdash; | 2 rod yn 1 elo uwd splytdy, n i &mdash;
I took the one less traveled by, | iat k dy-bi myn rutgon tekdy i,
And that has made all the difference. | n iat mekhq al z dyfr.
