Heavy rain and strong winds started hitting the northern part of the state on 28 April; by the following day, they had spread to almost the entire state. Storms occurring between 28 April and 1 May were caused by a cold front associated with a low-pressure area over the sea, while also being influenced by a moisture flow coming from the north of the country.[10] According to an INMET report, rainfall reached over 150 millimetres (5.91 in) in some parts of Rio Grande do Sul in 24 hours on 30th April;[11] they later reported that the average precipitation in the Porto Alegre area in the first twelve days of May could amount up to 333.1 millimetres (13.11 in), almost thrice the average monthly value recorded between 1991 and 2020 (113 millimetres (4.4 in)).
