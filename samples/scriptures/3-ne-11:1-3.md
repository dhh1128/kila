there were a great multitude gathered together,| d gadrndy somltxim
of the people of Nephi, | d nifaivnt
round about the temple | ri templ
which was in the land Bountiful; | k bidy yn ter -xbundyk
and they were marveling and wondering | n ve mervldygo n uxndrdygo
one with another,| un ko ot
and were showing one to another | n codygo un a ot
the great and marvelous change | chanj gran n mervlyk
which had taken place. | k hqpdyhq.

about this Jesus Christ, | ri ki -iecux -macaki-z
of whom the sign had been given | tcim z sein d gyvdyhq
concerning his death. | ri ed mort.

while they were thus conversing one with another, | dr ve kovrsdygo donk un ko ot,
they heard a voice | e hirdy un vos
as if it came out of heaven; | dr yf e kxmdyvw\* es\* siel<br>---<br>\* subjuntive mood<br>\* "out of", not just "out" 
and they cast their eyes round about, | n ve lwkdy vxri
for they understood not | pask ve no kendy
the voice which they heard; | z vos k ve hirdy
and it was not a harsh voice, | n e no bidy vos harc,

insomuch that there was no part of their frame | talkx d bidy no part d id korp
that it did not cause to quake; | k e no kasdy kueikn;
