O ye people of my church, | ho vw ant d id krk,
saith the voice of him who dwells on high | se vos d e k xbit an hai
and whose eyes are upon all men | nd ai bi an al ant
yea, verily I say: | si, i se vreyk: 
Hearken ye people from afar; | harkdu vw ant d lon;
and ye that are upon the islands of the sea | n vw k bi an vxisl d mar
listen together. | lysdu gqdryk
