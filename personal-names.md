# Personal Names

Each of a person's names is written with a haifa in front of it (essentially, capitalizing it as a proper noun).

Kila distinguishes the following categories of names for people:

* nom gyvn
* nom tekn
* nom im
* nom kuant

A person may have names from some or all of these categories, and may have more than one name in a given category.



## nom gyvn
A *nom gyvn* is a name a parent gives to a child when they become part of the family (when they are born or adopted). In most English-speaking cultures, the so-called "first name" and "middle name" are both *nom gyvn*. If a girl's birth certificate says their name is "Lori Jo Felicia Sorensen", "Lori", "Jo", and "Felicia" are *nom gyvn*, and they are used in that order. In cultures that put the family name first, all the formal names after the family name are *nom gyvn*. For example, in the full Chinese name 洪美丽 (Hong Mei-Li), 美丽 (Mei-Li) is the *nom gyvn*.

In kila, a *nom gyvn* is always the full, formal version of the name, as the parents gave it (Stephen, not Steve).

If a *nom gyvn* consists of more than one word, the words are always hyphenated when written in kila. The Chinese example of Mei-Li shows this pattern; the two words "Mei" and "Li" are intended to be used together, in that order, and thus constitute one name, mei-li, in kila, whether or not the words are hyphenated in an English transliteration. Similarly, if "Lori Jo" is intended to be viewed as an indivisible unit, it is transliterated as "lori-djo" in kila.

## nom tekn
A *nom tekn* is a nickname, a short form, a sobriquet, or any other personal name that a person accepts and uses on a less formal basis. A child with a who is named "Stephen" might have a *nom tekn* of "Steve" and another *nom tekn* of "Stevie". If Stephen later becomes a military pilot and starts using the callsign "Digger", this becomes a *nom tekn* as well. If Stephen likes his friends to call him by his initials, "SJ", this is also a *nom tekn*. The verb "tekn" in this category reflects the idea that the association between person and name is intended by the person; disliked nicknames or handles used by third parties do not qualify.

## nom im
A *nom im* associates a person with a group. In many cultures, the "family name" is a *nom im*. In the name "Alice Jones", "Jones" is a *nom im*, and in the Chinese name 洪美丽 (Hong Mei-Li), 洪 (Hong) is the *nom im*.

However, the group in a *nom im* does not have to be a family. It could also be a clan or tribe name, a profession, or a place name. The English surnames "Smith", "Farmer", and "Cooper" associate a person with patrilineal ancestors today, but originally referred to profession. The last 2 words in "Vasco da Gama" and "Ponce de Leon" reference place names and would be classified as *nom im* in kila.

## nom kuant
A *nom kuant* doesn't have a direct analog in other languages, but it is somewhat like a combined matronym/patronym. It refers to a specific nuclear family.

There are two forms of a *nom kuant* &mdash; the *standard form* and the *natal form*.

When a romantic couple becomes a family, they choose the standard form of their *nom kuant* together, and it effectively acts as a new surname for both of them. This name consists of two parts &mdash; one provided by each partner &mdash; separated by the word /kn/ ("spouse or partner"). Normally the word that each contributes is their own first or preferred *nom gyvn*, although this can be shortened or replaced with a *nom tekn* or even an arbitrary word in some cases. (The more surprising the substitution, the more opaque the genealogy &mdash; and people who don't speak kila have no basis for choosing anything else &mdash; so exceptions are rare.)

Normally, the partner who has the earlier birthday in a given calendar year is called the /kn mens/ ("start spouse") and contributes the first part of the name; the partner who has the later birthday is called the /kn kmplet/ ("complete spouse") and contributes the second part. For example, if Sofia and Alexander are a couple, and Sofia was born in February while Michael was born in May, their *nom kuant* would traditionally be /so-kn-qleks/ or /sofi-kn-ql/ or similar.

Children born to this couple use the *nom kuant* of their parents like a surname, but they put a /co/ ("child") prefix on it. This is the *natal form* of the *nom kuant* and is a gender-neutral variant on the old convention in English of giving a woman's maiden name by prefixing it with "née". Thus, children of Sofia and Alexander would identify their nuclear family of origin as /co-sofi-kn-al/.

When children grow up, if they pair off and create a *nom kuant* of their own, they begin to use the new *nom kuant* like a surname instead. The natal *nom kuant* continues to belong to them, but they only use it in formal recitations (see below).

## Identifying oneself
The common way to ask for a person's name in kila is /uat bi wd nom?/ ("What is your name?"), to which the answer would be a preferred *nom tekn* or *nom gyvn*: /i bi dqniel/ or /id nom bi dqniel/.

A more precise question might be /uat bi wd nom kmplet?/ ("What is your full name?") This would elicit a response that includes the previous answer, followed by a person's primary *nom kuant*. Names are always given in the gyvn/tekn, then kuant order.

An even more precise question might be /uat bi wd nom sokmplet?/ ("What is your extra full name?"). This elicits an extremely formal recitation: all *nom gyvn*, in order, followed by the natal *nom kuant*, followed by the standard *nom kuant* (if any), followed by a list of *im nom* (if any), in order of acquisition:
