# Personal Names

Kila distinguishes the following categories of names for people:

* nom gyvn
* nom tekn
* nom kuanta
* nom im

## nom gyvn
A "nom gyvn" is the name a parent gives to a child when they are young. In most English-speaking cultures, we might be tempted to equate this with a person's "first name", but this is not quite correct. However, a "middle name" is also a "nom gyvn". If someone's birth certificate says their name is "Mary Anne Felicia Sorensen", ", and . such names may consist of more than one word "Mary Anne". Examples: Stephen, María, Ivan, Karkita, José. In kila, a given name is always the full, formal version of the name, as the parents gave it (Stephen, not Steve).

## nom tekn
A "nom tekn" is a nickname, a short form, a sobriquet, or any other personal name that's associated with a person  on a less formal basis. A child with a who is named "Stephen" might have a "nom tekn" of "Steve" and another "nom tekn" of "Stevie".
