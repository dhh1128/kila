# Borrowing and transliteration

When a word or phrase is borrowed into kila, it can be written two ways: in its native script, or in kila.

If the borrowing is written in its native script ([kqm](alphabets.md#kqm)), it is called a *kqmcn*. A kqmcn's foreignness may be obvious because of accents, capitalization, or spelling that clearly violates kila norms. In this case, it is usually written directly, without any special notation: *i hqdygx aft déjà vu* 'I often used to have déjà vu'. However, in contexts where a kqmcn could be misinterpreted as kila, it is delimited with asterisks and is called an *eskqmcn*: *yz vu vyzdy ki \*meme\*?* 'Did you see this meme?' In documents, asterisks are often used only once per kqmcn &mdash; the first time the kqmcn appears. In rare cases, kqmcn can be inflected according to their native rules: *id \*laptops\* bi brekn* 'my laptops are broken'. More commonly, kqmcn are inflected by kila rules, in which case they are written with asterisks around the base form but not the inflections: *id vx\*laptop\* bi brekn* 'my laptops are broken'.

A borrowing can also be written phonetically in kila ([fim](alphabets.md#fim), in which case it is called a *fimcn*. Fimcn are written and inflected just like ordinary kila words. Kqmcn that get used regularly and inflected tend to become fimcn over time.

Proper nouns and highly technical terms that help communicate with a non-kila audience are generally kqmcn. General-purpose verbs and adjectives tend to be fimcn.

[Personal names](personal-names.md) are kqmcn if their owner prefers to identify in a native script, but *nom gyvn* are typically equated to a parenthesized fimcn on first use, with the fimcn being the standard way to refer to the person thereafter.

When constructing fimcn, best effort mappings from source sounds to kila phonology are used. [Stress rules in kila](prosody.md) cause some vowels to collapse to /x/ to make it obvious that another syllable is emphasized. However, apostrophes are preferred to /x/ reduction in proper nouns and personal names, if emphasis on a particular syllable is needed and vowel reduction would cause a significant distortion.
