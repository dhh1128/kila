# Borrowing

Kila borrows concepts, words, and morphemes liberally from other languages. The effect is strongest for English, but there are also borrowings from Romance languages, and from a few other sources. The reason to do this is to make kila faster to learn and easier to remember for many speakers.

However, when kila borrows, it almost never borrows an inflected form; it borrows a root, instead, and then follows its own extremely consistent morphological rules.

Consider the English word *psychological*. This word can be analyzed as a root, *psych*, and then the ending *-ology*, and then the ending *-ical*. Kila borrows the root, *psyche* &rarr; *saik* &mdash; 'mind', and then applies its own morphological transformations: *saikloji &mdash; 'psychology, formal study of the mind', *saikyk* &mdash; 'mental', *nirsaikr* &mdash; 'psychic (a mentalist or parapsychic practitioner)', etc.

See [foreign text](writing.md#foreign-text) for rules about writing borrowings in kila text.
