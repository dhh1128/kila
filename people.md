# People

Most people words have a form that doesn't imply any gender, which can then be combined with a *hi-* or *ci-* prefix to make an explicit gender claim. Mother, father, brother, sister, and concept derived from them also have an explicit gendered form that combines the prefix and the root concept in a single syllable. People who are well known to a speaker tend to be described with the short form.
