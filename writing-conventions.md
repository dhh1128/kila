# Writing Conventions

1. No capitals.
1. One-syllable words ending in /x/ are written without the trailing vowel: *nx* &rarr; *n*, *dx* &rarr; *d*.
1. Sequences of one-syllable words like this are written just as consonant clusters: *nx dx* &rarr; *nd*
1. Quotes are offset with */-* and *-/*, which has spaces before and after it. This punctuation mark is typically read as a pause, so it doesn't need an associated comma before or after. Nested quotes append an additional hyphen:

    He said, "I will tell her 'Come today!'" &rarr;

    *ei seidy /- i telvy d ei /-- kxmdu kijum! --/ -/.*
    
    If and only if what's quoted includes natural punctuation (e.g., it's a quoted question or exclamation, as shown above), the punctuation goes inside the quotes. However, quoted punctuation never finishes the sentence of the quoter, which is why the kila example above ends with a period.

1. The first word of a proper noun or personal name is preceded by a hyphen, if it is a kila word: *i d nom bi -dqnil. This is the equivalent of capitalizing in English. Words that are capitalized already in another language are not given this treatment.

1. Text is emphasized (italicized) by surrounding it with asterisks: ei bi \*sobyg\*.

1. Foreign words or phrases are surrounded by underscores, if they are lower case: i hav \_déjà vu\_. However, if the foreign word or phrase is capitalized, this is unnecessary: i abit yn Switzerland.
