# Writing conventions

* Proper nouns (a label for a unique person or object) preceded with a hyphen. This includes titles of creative works, headings in a document. What about references to same? Subsequent appearances? Geographical features?
* One-syllable words ending in vowel /x/ omit the x.
* first word in sentence?
