# Writing Conventions

1. Written left-to-right in pure ASCII.

1. No capitals.

1. One-syllable words ending in /x/ are written without the trailing vowel: *nx* &rarr; *n*, *dx* &rarr; *d*.

1. Sequences of one-syllable words like this are written just as consonant clusters: *nx dx* &rarr; *nd*. Pronouns are added to these clusters: *nx i dx* &rarr; *nid* 

1. Quotes are offset with */-* and *-/*, which has spaces next to the slash but no space next to the hyphen. This punctuation mark is typically read as a pause, so it doesn't need an associated comma before or after. Nested quotes append an additional hyphen:

    He said, "I will tell her 'Come today!'" &rarr;

    *e sedy /-i telvy de /--kxmdu kijum!--/-/.*
    
    If and only if what's quoted includes natural punctuation (e.g., it's a quoted question or exclamation, as shown above), the punctuation goes inside the quotes. However, quoted punctuation never finishes the sentence of the quoter, which is why the kila example above ends with a period.

1. The first word of a proper noun or personal name is preceded by a hyphen, if it is a kila word: *i d nom bi -dqnixl. This is the equivalent of capitalizing in English. Words that are capitalized already in another language are not given this treatment.

1. Text is emphasized (italicized) by surrounding it with asterisks: e bi \*sobyg\*.

1. Foreign words or phrases are surrounded by underscores, if they are lower case: i hav \_déjà vu\_. However, if the foreign word or phrase is capitalized, this is unnecessary: i abit yn Switzerland.

1. Dashes are written as 2 hyphens or an em dash, with spaces before and after. Question marks, exclamation points, commas, semicolons, and colons all bind to the word that precedes them, meaning they have no preceding space. Parens touch what they contain, and are offset from exterior text by a space.

1. Ellipses have 3 forms. The most common form is 3 dots attached to the full word that precedes it but detached from what follows. This is used when the elision does not include a sentence boundary. 3 dots detached on both sides are used when the elision includes a sentence boundary. 2 dots, attached on both sides, is called an "inclusive range ellipses". It can be used with preceding and following letters or full word (in which case the middle of a word or phrase is elided), or with preceding and following numbers (in which case, intermediate numbers are elided). This is a form of abbreviation.

1. One way to abbreviate is to elide middle characters and replace with 1 or 2 digits that represent the number of elided middle characters:
