# Writing Conventions

## Direction
1. Written left-to-right in pure ASCII.

## Capitalization
Normal text is spelled using an alphabet called the *gwm*, which consists of the 26 lower-case letters available in ASCII. The 26 upper-case letters are part of a different alphabet called the *fim*. See [Alphabet and phonology](alphabet-and-phonology.md).

The first word of a proper noun, personal name, or title is preceded with a single hyphen to signal its identifier status. This hyphen is silent when reading such words aloud.

## Contractions
One-syllable words ending in the vowel *x* are written without the trailing vowel: *nx* &rarr; *n*, *dx* &rarr; *d*.

Sequences of one-syllable words like this are written just as consonant clusters: *nx dx* &rarr; *nd*.

Pronouns followed by *dx* are added to these consonant clusters: *nx i dx* &rarr; *nid*.

Unlike contractions in other languages, kila contracts are only written. When spoken or read aloud, they are expanded. However, rapid speech will blur the sounds together, producing something close to the sounds in a naive reading of the contracted cluster.

## Quotes
Quotes are offset with */-* and *-/*, which have spaces next to the slash but generally no spaces next to the hyphen. These symbols are known as the *cwv* &mdash; 'quote' and the *vwc* &mdash; 'unquote', respectively. They are typically read as a pause, so they don't need an associated comma before or after. If the quoting context is a formal citation, the names of the marks are read aloud to indicate where the quote begins and ends. 

*e sedy /-kxmdu kiju!-/.* &mdash; He said, "Come today!"

Nested quotes require an additional hyphen after the cwv and before the vwc: */--* and *--/*. This results in what's called a *tocwv* and *tovwc &mdash; 'two quote' and 'two unquote'. Theoretically, this pattern of adding hyphens for more levels of nesting can continue, though even a *sicwv* is extremely unusual.

*e sedy /-i telvy de /--kxmdu kiju!--/-/.* &mdash; He said, "I will tell her 'Come today!'"

If and only if what's quoted includes natural punctuation (e.g., it's a quoted question or exclamation, as shown above), the punctuation goes inside the quotes. However, quoted punctuation never finishes the sentence of the quoter, which is why the kila examples above end with a period.

## Emphasis
Text is emphasized (italicized) by surrounding it with asterisks: e bi \*sobyg\*.

Foreign words or phrases are surrounded by underscores, if they are lower case: i hav \_déjà vu\_. However, if the foreign word or phrase is capitalized, this is unnecessary: i abit yn Switzerland.

## Other punctuation
Dashes are written as 2 hyphens -- or an em dash &mdash;, with spaces before and after. Question marks, exclamation points, commas, semicolons, and colons all bind to the word that precedes them, meaning they have no preceding space. Parens touch what they contain, and are offset from exterior text by a space.

Ellipses have 3 forms. The most common form, formally named *elyps*, is written as 3 dots attached to the full word that precedes it but separated from what follows by a trailing space. This is used when the elision does not include a sentence boundary.

The form where 3 dots are preceded and followed by spaces, called a *plulyps*, is used when the elision includes a sentence boundary.

The form written as 2 dots, and attached directly to text on both sides, is called a *tolyps*. It represents the elision of a *range*, where what precedes and follows the tolyps are the first and last items. A tolyps can be used with preceding and following letters or full word (in which case the middle of a word or phrase is elided), with letters of the [gym](alphabets.md#gwm) or [fim](alphabets.md#fim) (in which case intervening letters/symbols in the alphabet are elided), or with numbers (in which case, intermediate numbers are elided).

## Acronyms and abbreviations
Kila values conciseness, and supports several conventions for abbreviation.

One convention is to use a tolyps. For example, a kila translation of the Jules Verne novel, *Around the World in Eighty Days* might be titled *-ri z mund yn 80 ju*, and abbreviated as *-ri..ju*.

Another convention is to use [fi](alphabets.md#fim) to build an acronym, by converting each [gw](alphabets.md#gw) to its fi jum (roughly, by converting lower-case to capital letters). Acronyms typically drop small words, and they may be further truncated if their meaning is obvious. Thus, *-ri z mund yn 80 ju* could also be abbreviated as *-RM80*.

If context doesn't provide enough clarity about a fi's referent (e.g., in legal contracts or highly technical material), the first occurrence of the referent can be offset with hyphens and suffixed with the fi: -referent-fi (e.g., -afysr armnim -A). This explicitly defines a relationship. Thereafter, the fi by itself (e.g., A), or a relevant word with a hyphen+fi suffix (e.g., e-A) can be used wherever the referent would otherwise appear. This pattern can be used to establish arbitrary abbreviations or short forms, or to disambiguate pronouns:

1. One way to abbreviate is to elide middle characters and replace with 1 or 2 digits that represent the number of elided middle characters:
