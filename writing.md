# Writing

Written left-to-write, in pure ASCII.

There is no case distinction. Everything is lower case.

Punctuation has the same meaning and usage rules as general written English, with the following clarifications and stylistic conventions:

1. Dashes are written with spaces around them.

2. Question marks and exclamation points and commas all bind to the word that precedes them.

3. Numbers and numerical operators are always offset on either side by spaces. This means that if a number or numerical operator appears whether a non-space character is touching it, it is not numerical. This means that digits can be used in words as part of the alphabet.

4. Quotes are done with square brackets: She said [hello] . Nested quotes have doubled or tripled square brackets: She said [Why did you say [[hello]] ?] Punctuation is only inside quotes if it's actually part of what's quoted.
