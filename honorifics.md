# Honorifics and Titles

Honorifics and titles follow names, kind of like *-san* in Japanese or *-bhai* in Bengali, or like appending *, MD* or *, PhD* in English. A hyphen separates them from the preceding name. If more than one honorific is used, hyphens separate each one.

honorific | meaning
--- | ---
kn | spouse
cikn | missus
hikn | mister
nixn | friend. Most friends don't use this honorific with one another, but it might be used in a formal setting to reinforce the fact that one views the other in a friendly way, as when negotiating a treaty.
in | mark of tenderness and intimacy
ta | respect for an older generation, as when a child addresses a great aunt
z+&lt;honorific&gt; (one word), read as "zx &lt;honorific&gt;" | the definite article before the honorific means that the person is the prototype or epitome of the honorific. If no honorific follows "z", the preceding honorific becomes definite.
id+&lt;honorific&gt; (one word), read as "i dx &lt;honorific&gt;" | the possessive before the honorific means that the honorific has special significance to the speaker; in a series of honorifics, ones using this pattern come last. If no honorific follows "id", the preceding honorific becomes possessive/special.
melkr | governor, ruler, king, queen
leid | lord or lady
medir | doctor
lojir | scholar, PhD
lejr | lawyer
dam | woman, feminine
ai | man, masculine
cer | dear, beloved
