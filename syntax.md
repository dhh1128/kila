# Syntax

## Word order
Word order is SVO (subject-verb-object). This is approximately the same approach to ordering that's used by English, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, and Hindi. It's the most common word order in the world's languages. However, Samu is 100% regular in this choice, whereas most other languages are not.

Adjectives and adverbs always come after the noun or verb that they modify, and they are appended in order from least noteworthy to most noteworthy (a subjective judgment of the speaker).

    English: slimy green frogs
    Samu: /fragz slaimi grin fraghaus bryk uait small/ (small is what the speaker is emphasizing most, then white next, and brick the least)

Samu uses prepositions. 

## Agreement
There is no such thing as grammatical gender or number, and there are no agreement rules. Adjectives do not get inflected to agree with nouns or prounouns.
