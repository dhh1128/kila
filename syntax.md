# Syntax

## Word order
Word order is SVO (subject-verb-object). This is approximately the same approach to ordering that's used by English, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, and Hindi. It's the most common word order in the world's languages. However, kila is far more regular in this choice, whereas most other languages are not. See the [sample dialog from Jane Austen](samples/random/pride-and-prejudice.md) for some examples of English variation and kila consistency.

Adjectives and adverbs (or phrases that play an adjectival or adverbial role) always come after the noun or verb that they modify, and they are appended in order from least noteworthy to most noteworthy (a subjective judgment of the speaker).

    English: slimy green frogs
    Samu: /fragz slaimi grin fraghaus bryk uait small/ (small is what the speaker is emphasizing most, then white next, and brick the least)

Kila uses prepositions, not postpositions.

Negation come before what's negated:

* "i no hav nixn" (I don't have a friend)
* "i hav no nixn" (I have no friend)
* "id felys bi no nor" (My cat is non-black.)

## Agreement
In kila, there is no such thing as grammatical gender or number, and there are no agreement rules. Adjectives do not get inflected to agree with nouns or pronouns.
