## Word order

Word order is SVO (subject-verb-object). This is approximately the same approach to ordering that's used by English, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, and Hindi. However, Samu
is 100% regular in this choice, whereas most other languages are not. For example, in English we say: "The boy ate an apple" (SVO), but when this sentence is a question, a verb particle moves to the beginning: "Did the boy eat an apple?" (VSVO). There is a question marker word at the beginning of Samu questions, but it is not a conjugated verb; it is the particle /yz/.

Adjectives and adverbs always come after the noun or verb that they modify, and they are appended in order from least noteworthy to most noteworthy (a subjective judgment of the speaker).

    English: all these small white brick houses
    Samu: /haus bryk uait small/ (small is what the speaker is emphasizing most, then white next, and brick the least)

Samu uses prepositions.
