# Morphology, Inflection, Conjugation

## Decorators
These are short prefixes on nouns or suffixes on verbs that add extra meaning. They are the main way that inflection happens.

Prefix decorators are separate syllables if followed by a consonant, or usually just the consonant of the decorator if followed by a vowel. The first suffix decorators elides its vowel if the root it modifies ends in a vowel.

Decorator syllables are usually not stressed. (For artistic purposes -- e.g., to alter rhythm or rhyme in poetry -- vowel may be retained or optionally made to echo the proximate vowel from the root word instead.)

## Spread
Decorators bind in order of semantic relevance -- the more transformative of meaning and therefore the more noteworthy the decorator, the closer it prefers to bind to its root word. The measure of the semantic relevance of a decorator is called its "spread". Each decorator type has a default spread that is standard for all language speakers, but individual speakers can change the spread of a decorator subjectively (subtly altering the meaning).
