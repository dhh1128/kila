# Morphology, Inflection, Conjugation

## Decorators
These are short prefixes on nouns or suffixes on verbs that add extra meaning. They are the main way that inflection happens.

Prefix decorators are separate syllables if followed by a consonant, or usually just the consonant of the decorator if followed by a vowel. The first suffix decorators elides its vowel if the root it modifies ends in a vowel.

Decorator syllables are usually not stressed. (For artistic purposes &mdash; e.g., to alter rhythm or rhyme in poetry &mdash; vowel may be retained or optionally made to echo the proximate vowel from the root word instead.)

## Spread
Decorators bind in order of semantic relevance &mdash; the more transformative of meaning and therefore the more noteworthy the decorator, the closer it prefers to bind to its root word. The measure of the semantic relevance of a decorator is called its "spread". Each decorator type has a default spread that is standard for all language speakers, but individual speakers can change the spread of a decorator subjectively (subtly altering the meaning).

meaning | decorator | default spread | note
--- | --- | --- | ---
possessive | dx | 5 | 
plural (more than one) | vx- | 4 | vxdag = plural of dag (dog)
feminine | ci- | 1 | cidag = female dag; vxcidag = multiple female dogs
masculine | hi- | 1 | Both genders are marked.
diminutive or endearing | in- | 3 | indag = little dag; vxinsidag = cute female puppies
augmentive | gr- | 3 | grdag = great big dog
foul or evil or damaged | mei- | 2 | meidag = nasty dog
beautiful or good or pure | li- | 2 | lidag = beautiful dog

verb tense | vy = future, dy = past | 1 | sevy = will say, sedy = did say
imperative mood | du | 1 | sedu = say!
infinitive or past participle aspect | n | 1 | sen is not dun; 
ongoing aspect | gx | 2 | segx = is saying, sedygx = was saying, sevygx = will be saying
perfective aspect | hq | 3 | sehq = have said, sedyhq = had said, sehqvw = would have said, segxhqvw = would have been saying

reflexive aspect | zi | 0 | sezi = say to myself

A passive mood is expressed by replacing or following a subject with the preposition *dx*: *d rein* 'it's raining', *i d nasdy* 'I was born'.

An exigent mood (should, must, FR *il faut que*, ES *hay que*) is expressed by combining passive and imperative: *d bidu suanyk* 'one should be careful', ES 'hay que cuidarse'. This is a softer and less direct construction than *bidu suanyk* 'be careful' (a command) or 'w deb bin suanyk' 'you must be careful'.
