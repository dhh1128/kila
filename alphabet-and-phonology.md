# Alphabet and Phonology

Kila has a very simple, consistent correspondence between letters and sounds. The table below enumerates the alphabet (9 vowels, 17 consonants), in kila's own alphabetical order. This order proceeds from vowels to consonants; for vowels, from low to high and front to back; for consonants, from voiced to unvoiced and from front to back. The benefit of this sort order is that words that sort together alphabetically also have similar sounds.

The names of kila's letters are the vowel sounds themselves, for the vowels. For vocalic consonants, they are e+consonant. For voiced consonants, they are consonant+i. For unvoiced consonants, they are consonant+a.

letter | order | name | IPA | notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
a | 1 | a | a | vowel sound in English "on" or Spanish "pan"
x | 2 | x | ʌ | vowel sound in English "cut"
w | 3 | w | ʊ | vowel sound in English "put"
q | 4 | q | æ | vowel sound in English "cat"
e | 5 | e | ɛ | vowel sound in Spanish "es", similar to vowel in English "met" -- not the diphthong in English "raid"
y | 6 | y | I | vowel sound in English "kit"
i | 7 | i | i | vowel sound in English "need" or Spanish "mi"
o | 8 | o | o | vowel sound in Spanish "color" -- doesn't decay to /u/ like the vowel in English "go"
u | 9 | u | u | vowel sound in English "new" or Spanish "su"
m | 10 | em | m | can be vocalic
n | 11 | en | n | can be vocalic
l | 12 | el | l | can be vocalic
r | 13 | er | ɹ | initial consonant in English "red"; can be vocalic
b | 14 | bi | b | bilabial plosive as in English, not approximant as in Spanish
v | 15 | vi | v | labiodental fricative as in English, not approximant as in Spanish
d | 16 | di | d | alveolar as in English, not dental as in Spanish 
z | 17 | zi | z | 
j | 18 | ji | ʒ | sound written with "z" in English "azure"
g | 19 | gi | ɡ | always a "hard g" as in "gig"
p | 20 | pa | p | bilabial plosive as in English, not approximant as in Spanish
f | 21 | fa | f | labiodental fricative as in English, not approximant as in Spanish
t | 22 | ta | t | alveolar as in English, not dental as in Spanish
s | 23 | sa | s | 
c | 24 | ca | ʃ | sound written with "sh" in English "ship"
k | 25 | ka | k |
h | 26 | ha | h | initial consonant in English "house"

The following sounds can form minimal pairs with a single, similar consonant or vowel, but they are written as digraphs rather than single letters in kila. Unlike digraphs in English, the combined sound is an exact derivation of the two sounds in kila, so kila does not think of them as special sequences. However, they are noted here for those that may see them as special and wonder how the sounds are made and written:

digraph | IPA (sound) | note
--- | --- | ---
tc | tʃ | sound written with "ch" in English "chair"
dj | dʒ | sound written with "j" in English "joy"
oi | oi | diphthong written with "oy" in English "boy"
ai | ai | diphthong written with "i" in English "time"
ei | ei | diphthong written with "ay" in English "play"
au | au | dipthong written with "ow" in English "town"

Vowel digraphs beginning with "i" approximate the sound of the English letter "y" followed by the next vowel, or the IPA glide /j/. Vowel digraphs beginning with "u" approximate the English letter "w" followed by the next vowel. Kila does not view these glides as letters and corresponding consonants. Thus, a kila speaker would transliterate the English word "yes" as "ies", and "will" as "uyl".

## Sort order
Kila sorts whitespace characters first (and within whitespace, in byte order), then digits, then its own alphabet in the order shown, then every other byte of text in byte order.
