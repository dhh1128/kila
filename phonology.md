# Phonology

## Vowels
Like Spanish: /aioue/<br>
q = /æ/ as in /kæt/ (cat)<br>
y = /I/ as in /kIt/ (kit)<br>
x = /ʌ/ as in /kʌt/ (cut)<br>
w = /ʊ/ as in /pʊt/ (put)<br>

oi = [oy] as in b[oy]<br>
ai = [i] as in t[i]me<br>
ei = [a] as in t[a]ke<br>
au = [ow] as in t[ow]n

/lrmn/ and N can be vocalic.

## Consonants
/tdszkgpbfvnmlrh/ approximately as in English

The glides written with "w" and "y" in English are written with their vowel (e.g., the English word "yes" would be transliterated as /ies/, and "will" as /uyl/).

c = [sh] as in [sh]ip<br>
j = [zh] as in a[z]ure<br>

tc = [ch] as in [ch]ip<br>
