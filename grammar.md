1. Word order is SVO.
1. Indirect object follows direct object and is preceded by "dx": SVO dx indirect-object
1. Adjectives follow nouns: N adjective
1. Adverbs follow verbs: V adverb
1. Adjectives and adverbs stack up such that the most categorical are closer to what they modify, and the most incidental/variable are farther away.
1. Adverbs follow adjectives: adjective adverb (laden heavily)
1. The past participle of a verb is equivalent to its infinitive form, and is usable as an adjective.
1. Adjectives and adverbs are the same words, not derivations. Unlike English, there is not "weak" (adjective) and "weakly" (adverb derived from adverb). Position tells whether a word is adjective or adverb, and distinction doesn't matter that much anyway.
1. Articles are rarely used. Definite articles act like intensifiers.
1. Plural agreement is not a thing, and only enough plural is used to make things clear. In English, we say, "many hands make light work", but in kila, "many hand...", because many already conveys the plural.
