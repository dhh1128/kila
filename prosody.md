Kila does not have tones. It does not have long and short forms of sounds, either. However, it does have some conventions about stress and rhythm.

In kila, stress can be used to place special emphasis anywhere, and special stress is marked with an apostrophe before the emphasized syllable (analogous to bolding or italicizing a word). However, absent special emphasis, stress on syllables is predictable. Rules depend on whether the word appears in a sentence-like context, or in isolation, and on whether it is a content word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, name, multi-syllable preposition, interjection) or a grammatical word (pronouns, one-syllable preposition, determiner, particle, conjunction):

1. Productive prefixes and suffixes that are part of larger words (e.g., inflected endings or -n on verbs, pre-, ei-, -yk...) are never stressed, and they are ignored (in favor of a base form of the word) when analyzing stress patterns.
1. In isolation, one-syllable words and base forms are stressed.
4. In sentences, one-syllable content words acquire or lose stress to achieve an alternating rhythm with the words around them. One-syllable grammatical words are unstressed.
6. In both isolation and sentences, multi-syllable content words carry stress on the penultimate syllable of the base form.

Statements end with a falling tone. Questions begin with the question particle, *yz*, which is unstressed by default, and they end in a rising tone.
