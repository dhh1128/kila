Kila does not have tones. It does not have long and short forms of sounds, either. However, it does have some conventions about stress and rhythm.

In kila, stress can be used to place special emphasis anywhere, and special stress is marked with an apostrophe before the emphasized syllable (analogous to bolding or italicizing a word). However, absent special emphasis, stress on syllables is predictable:. Rules depend on whether the word appears in a sentence-like context, or in isolation, and on whether it is a content word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, name, multi-syllable preposition, interjection) or a grammatical word (pronouns, one-syllable preposition, determiner, particle, conjunction):

1. Productive prefixes and suffixes that are part of larger words (e.g., inflected endings or -n on verbs, pre-, ei-, -yk, -r, -cn...) are never stressed, and they are ignored (in favor of a base form of the word) when analyzing stress patterns.
1. In isolation, as in a glossary, one-syllable words and one-syllable base forms are stressed.
1. In sentences, one-syllable grammar words acquire or lose stress to achieve an alternating rhythm with the words around them. Base forms of content words that are one syllable are always stressed.
1. In both isolation and sentences, multi-syllable words and base forms prefer to carry stress on the penultimate syllable. However, if the penultimate syllable's nucleus is a vocalic /lrnm/, or if it is an /x/ that isn't followed by /lrmn/, then the preference for stress shifts to the final syllable. For example, the verb base forms *xbit* 'dwell' and *deprten* 'deprive' are stressed at the end. If the final syllable's nucleus is likewise unstressed, then the preference shifts to the antepenultimate syllable. If the antepenultimate syllable is likewise unstressed, then the penultimate is used.

    word | stress analysis
    --- | ---
    *aubpwtn* 'to forgive' | Remove -n, then stress penultimate syllable *aub* of root.
    *aubpwtgxhq* 'had been forgiving' | Remove -hq and -gz, same result as before.
    *eifynyk* 'infinite' | Remove ei- and -yk, stress one-syllable root *fyn*.
    *cisyb* 'sister' | Remove ci-, stress one-syllable root *syb*.
    *jxngl* 'jungle' | Prefer penultimate, but /x/ is penultimate nucleus, so look at final. Final is a vocalic /l/, so stress penultimate.
    *xbit* 'dwell, dwelling' | Prefer penultimate, but /x/ is penultimate nucleus, so look at final. Final is a strong vowel, so stress final.
    *deprtengx* 'depriving' | Remove -gx and de-. Penultimate nucleus is vocalic /r/, so stress final.
    *bxkxm* 'become' | Penultimate nucleus is /x/. Look at final. It's also /x/, but it's followed by /m/, so it keeps the stress.
    *ynten* 'intend, intend' | Penultimate nucleus is /y/, so keep stress there. Note this is different from English cognate.
    *devel* 'reveal' | Remove de-, stress one-syllable root *vel*.
    *ynjekcn* 'injection' | Remove -cn. Also remove yn- (most verbs that begin with this syllable are analyzed as having a prefix meaning 'directed inward'). Stress one-syllable root *jek*.
    *hikn* 'mister' | Both hi- and -kn are fixes. Keep both syllables and stress penultimate. Reinforced by the fact that final syllable nucleus is a vocalic /n/.

Statements end with a falling tone. Questions begin with the question particle, *yz*, which is unstressed by default, and they end in a rising tone.
